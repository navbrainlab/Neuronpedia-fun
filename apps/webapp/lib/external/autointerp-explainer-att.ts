const systemMessage = `We're studying attention heads in a neural network. Each head looks at every pair of tokens in a short token sequence and activates for pairs of tokens that fit what it is looking for. Attention heads always attend from a token to a token earlier in the sequence (or from a token to itself).

We will display multiple instances of sequences with the "to" token surrounded by double asterisks (e.g., **token**) and the "from" token surrounded by double square brackets (e.g., [[token]]). If a token attends from itself to itself, it will be surrounded by both (e.g., [[**token**]]).

Look at the pairs of tokens the head activates for and summarize in a single sentence what pattern the head is looking for. We do not display every activating pair of tokens in a sequence; you must generalize from limited examples.

Remember, the head always attends to tokens earlier in the sentence (marked with ** **) from tokens later in the sentence (marked with [[ ]]), except when the head attends from a token to itself (marked with [[** **]]).

The explanation takes the form: "This attention head attends to {pattern of tokens marked with ** **, which appear earlier} from {pattern of tokens marked with [[ ]], which appear later}." The explanation does not include any of the markers (** **, [[ ]]), as these are just for your reference.

Sequences are separated by ${ATTENTION_SEQUENCE_SEPARATOR}.`;
